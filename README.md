# forward-backward-secure-PCH
We provide both the source code and the full version of the paper.

For source code, we implement PCH at NDSS'19 and our forward/backward-secure PCH (i.e., FB-PCH). We use Python and Charm Framework to implement them.

We also provide the implementation of PCH and FB-PCH with BN254 curve.
