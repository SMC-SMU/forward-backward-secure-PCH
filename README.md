# forward-backward-secure-PCH
We provide both the source code and the full version of the paper (for future submission).

For source code, we provide both PCH and FB-PCH (forward/backward-secure PCH), we use Python and Charm Framework to implement it.

Regarding FB-PCH, one important building block is FB-ABE. This primitive is an ABE scheme with forward security and backward security. If one removes forward security, it becomes revocable RABE scheme. 

We will keep updating the full version of the paper (called manuscript).
